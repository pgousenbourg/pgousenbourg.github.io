				I'm currently a teaching assistant at <a href="http://www.uclouvain.be">UCL</a>, supervising the practical sessions both at <a href="http://www.uclouvain.be/epl">EPL</a> (the engineer school of UCL) and at <a href="http://www.uclouvain.be/espo">ESPO</a> (the faculty of Economic, Social and Political Sciences and Communication). Working on two very different contexts is very rewarding, by the way: think about it if you follow the same curriculum as me ;-).</p>
			<p>
				As a TA, I have the opportunity to participate to new teaching methodologies. At EPL, we apply the so-called "APP" methodology (Apprentissage Par Projet). In this methodology, the students learn of (simplified) real-life situations. The teacher and assistants are there to guide them in their learning, verifying that they go in the good direction... and that they actually learn something useful for the class !

				I also had the opportunity to participate to <a href="https://aipu2016.wordpress.com/">AIPU2016</a> a conference about pedagogy at university level.
